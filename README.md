# Jack Leary
This is some placeholder text that I'm only writing because I was bored of seeing the GitHub placeholder text. 

I like biostats and boats.

# Reminders
For some reason the process for pushing to this repository is different from what I typically do. I need to use: 

```
git push origin main
```

I'm putting this here so that I don't forget and run `git push origin master` again then wonder why it isn't working.


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jr-leary7/jr-leary7.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
