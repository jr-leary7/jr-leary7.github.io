# About Me 

My name's Jack, and I'm currently working through an M.S. in Biostatistics at the University of Florida. In the spring of 2020 I completed a B.S. in Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill (RIP my graduation). I'm also currently employed in healthcare analytics at Florida Blue in Jacksonville, FL. 

Outside of work, I love playing volleyball, sailing, reading, and music. I also speak French (somewhat poorly). Hopefully I'll be able to work in some neat analyses of my hobbies here. 

# Research Interests
## Academic 
From June 2019 through July 2020, I worked as a biofinformatics research assistant in [the Yeh Lab at UNC's Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://unclineberger.org/yehlab/). This was a transformative experience for me thanks to my colleagues in the lab and especially [Dr. Jen Jen Yeh](https://endeavors.unc.edu/the-synergistic-scientist/). While studying genomics and pancreatic cancer in the Yeh Lab, I was privileged to work with lots of next generation sequencing (NGS) data - specifically RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and scRNA-seq. Single cell RNA captivated me, and I'm currently interested in the devlopment of statistical and computational methods for the optimization of cell cluster discovery and validation.

I'm also a huge proponent of [\#reproducibleresearch](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23reproducibleresearch&src=typed_query), and to that end am interested in research computing methods, statistical software development, and science communications.  


## Professional 
I feel like I've focused a lot on my academic career, but I also do work 9-5 at Florida Blue in healthcare analytics as of July 2020. I've enjoyed learning about the US healthcare system, and have been able to expand my competencies with Python and SQL. With respect to healthcare, I'm interested in equity & access disparities, the improvment of care delivery using classical statistical models, and population health.
