This is some placeholder text that I'm only writing because I was bored of seeing the GitHub placeholder text. 

I like biostats and boats.


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jr-leary7/jr-leary7.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
